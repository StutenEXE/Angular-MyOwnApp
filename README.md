# AngularMyOwnApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.8.
Big thanks to Deborah Kurata for her course on pluralsight that allowed me to do this app (it is heavily inspired from her demo site)

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## The point of it all

This project is here for me to learn to use Angular through TypeScript
